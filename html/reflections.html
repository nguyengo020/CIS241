	<div class="question">What I have learned in this class?</div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">I have learned a lot after finishing this class since I am pretty new to technology, in specifically web design. Before this class, 
	I had purchased several different courses on Udemy talking about web design. However, due to time limitation, I am not able to finish 
	the whole course and gain a deep understanding about it. Also, when looking at online videos, they tend to move around and explain things
	very quickly, so it is hard to keep track what is going on. So, I am so lucky that I am part of this class this quarter and learn a lot of 
	great things about web design with a really clear explanations and great assignments assigned every week. Thank you very much.</p>
	<div class="question">What I like about this class?</div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">There are a lot of things I like about this class. The first thing is that the course is very organized and easy to keep track. Level of 
	difficulties and the amount of time needed to spend for the assignment is the same throughout the course. It helps students a lot when they 
	try to organize their schedule within the week. Another thing that I like about the course is that course material on Canvas as well on the 
	book is easy to understand. Books are really helpful in this class because it shows everything you need to do through out the course including
	the discussion and labs. If not, the material is foundable through Google searching. You don't have to ask your professor for clarification 
	and waste a bunch of times. Overall, I would recommend this course to any of the students who are looking for something to explore. There are 
	way more than this, but I am busy this week with all the finals and deadlines.</p>
	<div class="question">What I don't like about this class?</div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px">There are two things that I don't like about this class is that sometimes the assignments are published late when I already planned to work 
	for it on my schedule. However, the due date is also shift to the same number of days that it is published late. So, I think it is just a small
	problem to care about. Another thing that I don't like about this class is that we have little engagement with other students in the class. I know 
	that we have the discussions where we reply to each other's post. However, I believe that it is better to talk with people about it. However, there 
	will be a lot of problems with this due to time conflict.</p>
